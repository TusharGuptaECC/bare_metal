# bare_metal
This repo consists of libraries for various microcontrollers. Currently, it has ATmega328p, TM4C123H6PMT7. 
Most of the libraries for ATmega328p also work fine for ATmega16 and ATmega2560 (if the same pin exists on them, otherwise pin name and number have to be changed according to the requirement).
